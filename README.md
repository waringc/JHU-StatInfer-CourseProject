## Coursera- Statistical Inference Course Project

This is the final course project for the Johns Hopkins Reproducible research course found here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference

The project instructions are as follows:

###Part 1- Simulation Exercise

>In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

>Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. You should

>1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.

>2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

>3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

###Part 2- Basic Inferential Data Analysis

>Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

>1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

>2. Provide a basic summary of the data.

>3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)

>4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
